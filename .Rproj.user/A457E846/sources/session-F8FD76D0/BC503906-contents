## Bio

Hello! I am a Graduate Research Assistant under the advisement of Dr. Matthew Kumjian at the Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on the micro-physics of convective storm systems, using remote sensing data. I have a broad interest in the spacial features of weather systems and seek to conduct sound and interesting science using novel research methods with remote sensing data.

<!--On this site I keep a list of [my publications](papers), [presentations](presentations), and my CV.-->
