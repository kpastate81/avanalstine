My research focuses on developing novel analysis techniques for dual-polarization Doppler radar data, applicable to exploring the links between the radar observables and microphysical properties of convective storms. I received both my B.S. in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science and B.S. in Finance from Penn State and prior to graduate school, I worked as a financial administrator for astronomical instrumentation mission operations.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my resume."
