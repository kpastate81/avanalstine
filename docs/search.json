My research focuses on the micro-physics of convective storm systems using remote sensing data. I have a broad interest in the spacial features of weather systems and seek to conduct sound and interesting science using novel research methods on remote sensing data.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my resume."
